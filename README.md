# HeroSign
HeroSign is a videogame made with Pygame that can recognize the hand pose using MediaPipe Hands and by using a Random Forest model, the landmark data can be classified and labelled into Amercian Sign Language letters/characters as a mechanism to control the main (playable) character, the Hero (you of course!). Enjoy!
